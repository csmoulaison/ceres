report here. These are in reverse chronological order, so add to the top when

02.25.2026: RENDER LIST INSTANCES... AGAIN
	I ran into a similar bug recently where I forgot about an implementation detail
related to the render lists, which is the way instances are stored: instances
are pre-allocated a certain amount of space on each frame, which initializes 
offsets into a buffer. Instances of each type are then added to the buffer 
at a position relative to their type's offset. 
	The problem is, an unused variable from a previous implementation entitled 
instances_len still existed in the RenderList struct, and so naturally I used 
that to iterate the instances for interpolating between RenderLists as part of
implementing Glenn Fiedler's fixed timestep approach. Of course, this didn't 
properly interpolate the instances as it didn't skip to the appropriate parts of
the buffer to find the instances it needed to interpolate.
	LESSON: I should be more aggressive about making sure that refactors don't
leave unused state around that has any possibility of misleading myself in the
future. For now, I am removing the offending variable.
